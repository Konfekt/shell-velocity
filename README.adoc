== Features

* Removes cognitive load by combining the note creation and note searching
* Customizable (use your preferred fuzzy finder or file picker; see link:docs/tested-pickers.adoc[tested pickers])
* Uses whatever editor you want (even link:docs/visual-studio-code.adoc[Visual Studio Code])
* Portable (runs on every POSIX compatible OS, see link:docs/tested-oses.adoc[Tested OSes])
* Minimal (only a POSIX shell and the picker of your choice)
* Nonintrusive (use markdown by default, but works also with your preferred markup languages such as: https://orgmode.org/[org], https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg[neorg], rest, https://asciidoc.org/[adoc], etc)

== Dependencies

* POSIX compliant shell
* POSIX utils
* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[`fzf`] or your favorite picker (e.g. fzy, rofi, dmenu, etc)

== Installation

IMPORTANT: Make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

[,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saccarosium/shell-velocity/main/shv -o ~/.local/bin/shv
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/shv
----

== Usage

NOTE: Every subcommand that uses your `$SHV_PICKER` is capable of creating a new file directly from the picker if not match is found.

=== Available commands

[,bash]
----
shv # select a note
shv scratch # open scratchpad file
shv diary # select a note from diary folder
shv [today | t] <label> # edit todays diary note
shv [tomorrow | tom | tm] <label> # edit tomorrow diary note
shv [yesterday | ye | y] <label> # edit yesterday diary note
----

==== no subcommand

`grep` all the files with your selected extension in your `$SHV_PATH`. If no match is found, or you use the keybinding to create a note, a new note will be created.

==== bookmarks

Edit a file you edit often by simply using the number is located in `$SHV_BMS`

[,bash]
----
shv bookmarks 1 # By default will edit "stratchpad.md"
----

==== diary

Searches in your `$SHV_DIARY_PATH` for notes, and uses your picker to select what daily file to choose.

==== yesterday, today and tomorrow

Get the corresponding daily note associated with the day. If passed a `label` that label will be prepended to the filename with an `_` character.

[,bash]
----
shv today school # It will edit the file school_2023-01-01.$SHV_EXT
----
