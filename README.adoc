== Usage

NOTE: The documentation is under `./docs/shv.adoc`. It is in HTML and asciidoc
format choose what you like more.

The first design goal of this script is to make creating and searching notes as
frictionless as possible. First you run `shv` without subcommands. You will be
presented with a grep search of all your notes. Search for what you where
looking for and if you don't find it you simply press enter and a new note will
be created by your query.

== Philosophy

[quote,scrod creator of notational_velocity]
The reasoning behind Notational Velocity's present lack of multi-database
support is that storing notes in separate databases would 1) Require the same
kinds of decisions that category/folder-based organizers force upon their users
(e.g., "Is this note going to be work-specific or home-specific?"), and 2)
Defeat the point of instantaneous searching by requiring, ultimately, the user
to repeat each search for every database in use.


By providing a default directory, we offer (one) fix to the first issue.

By searching the whole set of directories simultaneously, we handle the second.

It also handles Notational Velocity's issue with multiple databases. UNIX does
not allow repeated filenames in the same folder, but often the parent folder
provides context, like in `workout/TODO.md` and `coding/TODO.md`.
