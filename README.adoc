== Features

* Removes cognitive load by combining the note creation and note searching
* Customizable (use your preferred fuzzy finder or file picker; see link:docs/tested-pickers.adoc[tested pickers])
* Uses whatever editor you want (even link:docs/visual-studio-code.adoc[Visual Studio Code])
* Portable (runs on every POSIX compatible OS, see link:docs/tested-oses.adoc[Tested OSes])
* Minimal (only a POSIX shell and the picker of your choice)
* Nonintrusive (use markdown by default, but works also with your preferred markup languages such as: https://orgmode.org/[org], https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg[neorg], https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html[rst], https://asciidoc.org/[adoc], etc)

== Dependencies

* POSIX compliant shell
* POSIX utils
* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[`fzf`] or your favorite picker (e.g. fzy, rofi, dmenu, etc)

== Installation

=== Arch Linux (AUR)

[,bash]
----
yay -S shell-velocity-git
----

=== Manual

IMPORTANT: Make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

[,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saccarosium/shell-velocity/main/shv -o ~/.local/bin/shv
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/shv
----

== Usage

The first design goal of this script is to make creating and searching notes as frictionless as possible. First you run `shv` without subcommands. You will be presented with a grep search of all your notes. Search for what you where looking for and if you don't find it you simply press enter and a new note will be created by your query.

NOTE: For more commands and information run `shv help`

== Philosophy

[quote,scrod creator of notational_velocity]
The reasoning behind Notational Velocity's present lack of multi-database support is that storing notes in separate databases would 1) Require the same kinds of decisions that category/folder-based organizers force upon their users (e.g., "Is this note going to be work-specific or home-specific?"), and 2) Defeat the point of instantaneous searching by requiring, ultimately, the user to repeat each search for every database in use.


By providing a default directory, we offer (one) fix to the first issue.

By searching the whole set of directories simultaneously, we handle the second.

It also handles Notational Velocity's issue with multiple databases. UNIX does not allow repeated filenames in the same folder, but often the parent folder provides context, like in `workout/TODO.md` and `coding/TODO.md`.
